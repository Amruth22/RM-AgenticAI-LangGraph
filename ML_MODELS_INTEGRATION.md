# 🤖 ML Models Integration Guide

## Overview

The RM-AgenticAI-LangGraph system now has **full ML model integration** with your uploaded models! The system intelligently uses ML models when available and gracefully falls back to rule-based predictions when needed.

## 📁 Uploaded Models

You have successfully uploaded all required ML models:

### ✅ Risk Assessment Models
- **`risk_profile_model.pkl`** - Trained risk classification model
- **`label_encoders.pkl`** - Feature encoders for risk model

### ✅ Goal Success Models  
- **`goal_success_model.pkl`** - Goal achievement prediction model
- **`goal_success_label_encoders.pkl`** - Feature encoders for goal model

## 🔧 System Integration

### Automatic Model Loading
The system automatically detects and loads your ML models:

```python
# Risk Assessment Agent
class RiskAssessmentAgent(CriticalAgent):
    def _load_models(self):
        try:
            self.risk_model = joblib.load("models/risk_profile_model.pkl")
            self.label_encoders = joblib.load("models/label_encoders.pkl")
            self.logger.info("Risk assessment models loaded successfully")
        except Exception as e:
            self.logger.error(f"Failed to load risk models: {str(e)}")
            # Falls back to rule-based assessment

# Goal Planning Agent  
class GoalPlanningAgent(CriticalAgent):
    def _load_models(self):
        try:
            self.goal_model = joblib.load("models/goal_success_model.pkl")
            self.goal_encoders = joblib.load("models/goal_success_label_encoders.pkl")
            self.logger.info("Goal prediction models loaded successfully")
        except Exception as e:
            self.logger.error(f"Failed to load goal models: {str(e)}")
            # Falls back to rule-based prediction
```

### Intelligent Fallback System
- **🤖 ML Models Available**: Uses trained models for high-accuracy predictions
- **📊 Models Missing**: Automatically switches to rule-based algorithms
- **🔄 Mixed Mode**: Uses ML where available, rules where needed

## 🎯 Model Usage in Analysis

### Risk Assessment
**With ML Models:**
```python
# Prepares prospect data
input_data = {
    "age": prospect.age,
    "annual_income": prospect.annual_income,
    "current_savings": prospect.current_savings,
    "target_goal_amount": prospect.target_goal_amount,
    "investment_horizon_years": prospect.investment_horizon_years,
    "number_of_dependents": prospect.number_of_dependents,
    "investment_experience_level": prospect.investment_experience_level
}

# Encodes categorical variables
for col, encoder in self.label_encoders.items():
    if col in input_df.columns:
        input_df[col] = encoder.transform(input_df[col])

# Makes ML prediction
prediction = self.risk_model.predict(input_df)[0]
probabilities = self.risk_model.predict_proba(input_df)[0]

# Maps to risk levels: {0: "Low", 1: "Moderate", 2: "High"}
risk_level = risk_mapping[prediction]
confidence_score = float(max(probabilities))
```

**Without ML Models:**
```python
# Uses rule-based scoring
risk_score = 0
risk_score += age_factor + income_factor + horizon_factor + experience_factor
risk_score -= dependents_penalty

# Maps score to risk level
if risk_score >= 6: risk_level = "High"
elif risk_score >= 3: risk_level = "Moderate"  
else: risk_level = "Low"
```

### Goal Success Prediction
**With ML Models:**
```python
# Supports both classification and regression models
if hasattr(self.goal_model, 'predict_proba'):
    # Classification: predicts Likely/Unlikely
    probabilities = self.goal_model.predict_proba(input_df)[0]
    prediction = self.goal_model.predict(input_df)[0]
    goal_success = "Likely" if prediction == 1 else "Unlikely"
    probability = float(probabilities[1])
else:
    # Regression: predicts probability directly
    probability = float(self.goal_model.predict(input_df)[0])
    goal_success = "Likely" if probability > 0.6 else "Unlikely"
```

**Without ML Models:**
```python
# Calculates required monthly investment
required_monthly = target_amount * monthly_rate / ((1 + monthly_rate) ** months - 1)
affordable_investment = monthly_income * 0.2

# Determines feasibility
if required_monthly <= affordable_investment * 0.5:
    probability = 0.9  # Very achievable
elif required_monthly <= affordable_investment:
    probability = 0.7  # Achievable with discipline
else:
    probability = 0.4  # Challenging
```
